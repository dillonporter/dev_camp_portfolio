        <p>I've always been one that lives in the clouds, in my imagination. A dreamer you could call me. Full of ideas and ways to make things better. I was born and raised in the small town of Laie, Hawaii. I spent a lot of my time outside exploring, living the island life. As a teen I learned discipline and hardwork through athletics. I was later a collegiate All-American in tennis and for a time, a collegiate coach. Through sports I was able to interact and visit people from different cultures and beliefs. I gained an appreciation for diversity and thinking outside the box.   </p>

        <p>My interest in technology is founded on the creation of new ideas. On the improvement of what we see and experience. As a new developer, as a coach, as a recruiter, my goal ultimately is to enhance and enrich the lives we all live.</p>
